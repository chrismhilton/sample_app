<!-- a partial for stylesheet includes -->

<!--
Since the HTML5 standard is new, some browsers (especially Internet Explorer) don’t yet fully support it,
so we include some JavaScript code (known as an “HTML5 shiv”) to work around the issue.
Uses conditional comment supported by Internet Explorer browsers
so the enclosed line is only included if the version of IE is less than 9.

<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>

<!--
Include stylesheets on application pages
using built-in Rails helper "stylesheet_link_tag"
(the helper automatically appends the .css extension to the filenames);
Each line calls the stylesheet_link_tag function with two arguments:
a string, indicating the path to the stylesheet,
and a hash, indicating the media type (’screen’ for the computer screen and ’print’ for a printed version).
Because of the surrounding brackets <& and %>, the results are inserted into the template by ERb
-->

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/screen', :media => 'screen' %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/print',  :media => 'print' %>
<!--[if lt IE 8]><%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/ie' %><![endif]-->
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'custom', :media => 'screen' %>
