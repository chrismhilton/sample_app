    Application site layout - way to factor out common elements into a global layout
    with the body contents inserted on a per-page basis.
    The title is set using instance variable defined in controller
    using Embedded Ruby (ERb) hence the file extension ".erb".
    When we visit /pages/home, Rails executes the body of the home action,
    which makes the assignment @title = "Home".
    Rails then renders the view, using ERb to insert the value of @title into the template,
    which the web server then sends to your browser as HTML
