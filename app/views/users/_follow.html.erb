<!--
Partial for following a user
using Ajax to send requests asynchronously to the server without leaving the page
by including ':remote => true' (tells Rails to allow the form to be handled by JavaScript)
-->

<%= form_for current_user.relationships.build(:followed_id => @user.id),
             :remote => true do |f| %>
  <div><%= f.hidden_field :followed_id %></div>
  <div class="actions"><%= f.submit "Follow" %></div>
<% end %>
