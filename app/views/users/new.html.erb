<!--
The presence of the do keyword indicates that form_for takes a block
which has one variable called f for 'form'.
Requires a @user instance variable to be defined in the controller new action.
Rails creates the form tag using the @user object: because every Ruby object
knows its own class, Rails figures out that @user is of class User;
moreover, since @user is a new user, Rails knows to construct a form with the post method,
which is the proper verb for creating a new object.
The action="/users" and method="post" for elements constitute instructions
to issue an HTML POST request to the /users URL handled by the controller create action.
-->
<%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>

  <!-- render fields using partial explicitly passing pass the form variable f as a local variable -->
  <%= render 'fields', :f => f %>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit "Sign up" %>
  </div>

<% end %>
